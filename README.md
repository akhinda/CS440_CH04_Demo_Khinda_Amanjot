I chose the MIT license because it allows the source code to be modified and altered by anyone and does not hold me accountable for anything. It allows for the source code to be modified without anyone having to worry about limitations in regards to commericial use, distribution, modification, and also private use. This is one that I chose because I am not held accountable and the source code can be distributed freely. I believe this is a better license because I don't have as much to be worried about.
